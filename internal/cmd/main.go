ðŸŒ¶ tejolote is a utility that allows a developer to execute a
process - ideally a builder - and record its inputs and outputs.
The main goal is to obtain provenance information of builds
and other transformations when building and shipping software.

In its simplest form, you can precede your existing build
command with tejolote run and it will make its best to create a
meaningful attestation. For example:

	If your build command is:
	make build

	Change it with:
	tejolote run make build

Tejolote will try to make sane asumptions but for best results, it
allows for full control of the process you run.
